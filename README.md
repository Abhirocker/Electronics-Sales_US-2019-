# Electronics-Sales_US-2019
Used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

* Drop NaN values from DataFrame.
* Removing rows based on a condition.
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype).

After cleaned up the data, we move the data exploration section, where we solved business questions related to our data:

* What was the best month for sales?
* What city sold the most product?
* What products are most often sold together?
* What product sold the most?
